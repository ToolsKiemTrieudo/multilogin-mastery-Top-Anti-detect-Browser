**Kameleo** often gets mentioned as a competitor to **Multilogin**, but let’s be honest – it’s not even a fair fight. Multilogin dominates in every way, leaving Kameleo in the dust when it comes to features, performance, and reliability.

## Kameleo’s Weaknesses
- **Weak Fingerprinting**: Kameleo’s fingerprint tech isn’t strong enough to fool big platforms like Amazon or eBay.
- **Clunky Interface**: Kameleo’s interface is a mess, making it hard to use for large-scale campaigns.
- **Poor Performance**: Kameleo crashes when you run too many profiles, while Multilogin handles hundreds with ease.
