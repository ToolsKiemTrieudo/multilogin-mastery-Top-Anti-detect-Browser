Proxies are the key to staying anonymous online, and **Multilogin** makes proxy management a breeze. Unlike tools like AdsPower or GoLogin, which often fumble with proxy integration, Multilogin gives you ultimate flexibility to manage proxies like a pro.

## Why Multilogin Excels at Proxy Management
- **Seamless Integration**: Multilogin supports all proxy types – HTTP, SOCKS5, you name it. No more errors like you’d get with Kameleo.
- **Bulk Management**: Assign proxies to hundreds of profiles in just a few clicks, something Incogniton can’t handle.
- **Rock-Solid Stability**: Multilogin keeps your proxies connected, unlike GoLogin, which drops connections during heavy use.

## Real-World Use Case
I once managed 200 ad accounts for a campaign, each with its own proxy. Multilogin let me set everything up in under 15 minutes, and not a single proxy failed. Try that with AdsPower, and you’ll be stuck fixing errors all day.
